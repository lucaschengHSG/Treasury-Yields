81,"It looks like Russians are facing a large shortage of groceries or an even greater rise in prices.  Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service plans to introduce a ban on increasing food prices in 2024 by more than 30% within 60 days. The corresponding bill, developed on behalf of Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov, has already been sent to the government.  Large companies will be prohibited from raising prices by more than 30% for 60 days without an obvious reason - that is, if they cannot justify the increase with economic factors. Violators will first be given orders, the next step is to initiate a case. The goal is to stabilize food prices in Russia before the elections. The list of goods that the regulator will monitor will also be established by the government. Presumably, these will be the most socially significant products - meat, milk, eggs, bread, tea and others. Moreover, the anti-monopoly service will make a decision on unreasonable price increases based on data from the Ministry of Economic Development, the draft says.  At the same time, almost every fourth large company plans to increase prices to maintain operational efficiency, a new monitoring by the Russian Union of Entrepreneurs showed. In just one quarter, their share increased from 13.7 to 23%, becoming the highest since the spring of 2022. With this trend, before the end of the year, almost every company will raise prices. Among small companies, the percentage of those who plan to raise prices is many times greater.  But this is unlikely to keep prices down in Russia. After all, manufacturers have a lot of reasons to explain the growth - from the fall of the ruble and rising fuel prices to the rise in gas prices for industry. So it is unlikely that an artificial ban will keep prices low.","Dec 9, 2023 ¬∑ 10:14 AM UTC"

Man: Absolutely!  Me: (showing genuine interest):  How did he do it?  Man: Drill baby drill! American oil!  Me: I actually have family in the oil industry in Oklahoma. Trump actually asked the Saudis to increase production hurting the American oil industry. You know, the gas prices right now are just a few pennies more than when Trump left office, right?  Man: I don't know.  Me: Later he signed an agreement with the Saudis to restrict imports of oil, which caused gas prices to spike coming out of the pandemic.  Man: So you're a Biden guy, huh?  Me: No, I'm no politician's guy. I support what's right and true. I choose politicians that I believe will do the right thing for the right reasons.  Man: And you believe Biden is doing that?  Me: Yes. There's not a lot a President can do to impact gas prices, but the inflation reduction act did help. We know this because our fuel prices are much cheaper than most any other industrialized nation.  Man: I don't know if I believe that.  Me: Well, a belief isn't always a truth (smiling). Google it.  Man: (mumbles under his breath)  Me: Look, here are the facts, look them up. Gas was around $2.70 a gallon in 2019, right before the pandemic.  During the pandemic fuel consumption tanked, people were staying home.  Crude oil was actually selling on the market for a negative price.  As a result, gas prices dropped, going below $1 per gallon in 13 states in April of 2020. But jobs in the American oil industry dropped too!  American refineries either reduced or completely stopped production for a while.  As the pandemic waned, demand for fuel spiked as people return to work.  This was the beginning of inflation. Not just in fuel, but everything.  Man: You bet it was, just as Biden took office.  Me: True, but it's important to understand why.  Do you remember that lumber was high too?  Man: Yes, outrageously high!  Me: That's right, because the mills had shut down.  Do you remember what egg prices did?  Man: Through the roof!  Me: Yep, egg producers were slaughtering their chickens because they couldn't afford to feed them during the height of the pandemic. People weren't going to restaurants and eating eggs!  Man: I'm an old farmer, so that makes sense.  (We've long since finished filling up, but continue to have a friendly conversation).  Me: Look, it's important to put politics aside and look at the facts going in and then out of the pandemic.  As a pandemic grew, the pipeline of goods dwindled. As it waned, there was a pent-up demand and an increase in demand all at the same time. It took time to refill the supply line. This spiked prices!  Man: Did it ever!  Me: Remember all those container ships waiting to unload?  Man: Yes! Yes I do!  Me: But, look at what has happened since. Prices have steadily come down, even though a lot of corporations have kept their prices artificially high and reaped unbelievable profits. This is especially true of American oil companies.  Man: I heard something about that!  Me: But I will agree with you on one thing, Trump did, in fact, have a HUGE IMPACT on the big drop in fuel prices.  Man: Yes he did!  Me: But, he also greatly impacted all the inflation that followed!  Man: (a look of disbelief) How?  Me: By mismanaging the pandemic. His months of delays and denials worsened and lengthened its impact on everyone's live. It's estimated that he cost 750,000 Americans their lives!  Man: I don't believe that at all!  Me: you don't remember the denials? ""It'll be gone by Easter!""?  Man: Yeah, I do remember that, and that bleach thing was stupid.  Me: Valuable time lost.  Man: (extended his hand to shake mine) I gotta go, but I did enjoy our talk!  Me: Me too! Merry Christmas!  Man: (Smiles) didn't think you guys said Merry Christmas!

There are different methods and approaches that real estate valuers use to conduct property valuations in Nigeria, such as:  1. The Comparison Method:  This method compares the property with similar properties that have been sold or rented in the same area within a reasonable time frame.   The valuer adjusts the prices of the comparable properties to account for differences in features, quality, and market conditions.   This method is commonly used for residential and commercial properties that have an active and competitive market.  2. The Income Method:  This method estimates the value of a property based on the income it can generate, either from rent, lease, or other sources.   The valuer calculates the net income of the property after deducting expenses and applies a capitalization rate to derive the present value.   This method is suitable for income-producing properties such as hotels, office buildings, shopping malls, etc.  3. The Cost Method:  This method measures the value of a property based on the cost of acquiring the land and constructing the building, plus depreciation and obsolescence.   The valuer considers the current replacement cost of the property and deducts the loss in value due to physical deterioration, functional inadequacy, or external factors.   This method is often used for special-purpose properties that have no comparable market data, such as schools, hospitals, churches, etc.  So, you may think the valuations are inflated, but in more ways than not, they can be justified.","Dec 7, 2023 ¬∑ 7:01 AM UTC"

After a spike, Treasury bonds fell as Japanese debt was liquidated. - Hong Kong, mainland China, and Australia had weaker equity values as the S&P 500 saw its third consecutive day of declines. US futures remained stable. - After falling to 4.1% on Wednesday, the lowest level since August, 10-year Treasury rates increased. The seven-basis-point increase followed a selloff in Japanese sovereign debt and represents a wider shift in attitude observed in Australian bonds as well. - Japan's 10-year yield ended a three-day fall on Thursday, rising as much as 10.5 basis points to 0.75%. Weak demand from a 30-year government paper auction added to the move's strength. The yen gained 0.5% versus the US dollar. - The declines in energy producers following the oil price's lowest point since June due to oversupply worries and concerns about China's debt load following Moody's Investors Service's downgrade of several local companies and its earlier downgrade of the country's sovereign bond outlook were the main causes of the equity market's weakness. - Hao Hong, chief economist at Grow Investment, said, ""It is very surprising that Moody's has downgraded the outlook for a large number of Chinese companies.""

803,"The best month for bonds since the 1980s started a rally in everything.  In November, a month of record gains for the U.S. bond market, investors pushed up government and mortgage bond prices, marking the best performance since the 1980s. This surge was part of a broad market rally, including stocks, loans, and emerging markets. Even speculative and high-risk assets like obscure cryptocurrencies saw significant gains.  The rally was a much-needed boost for bond investors, who faced potential losses for a third straight year. The Bloomberg US Aggregate Index jumped 4.9% as ten-year bond yields fell to 4.26%. The rally's future hinges on economic slowdown, inflation decline, and the Fed's halt in interest rate hikes.  Soft employment and consumer price data, coupled with dovish statements from the Fed, fueled bond market optimism. The MSCI World Index and emerging market stocks climbed significantly, and the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index rose by 18%.  In the credit sector, U.S. junk bonds and ETFs tracking them saw notable increases. Traders now anticipate monetary policy easing in 2024, with potential interest rate cuts as early as the Fed's May meeting.  A shift in market sentiment, spurred by the prospect of a soft economic landing and lower borrowing costs, prompted bond fund managers to invest in longer-term bonds. This strategy has been reflected in significant gains for certain funds, with expectations that the trend could continue if the Fed's policy shift becomes evident.","Nov 30, 2023 ¬∑ 1:17 PM UTC"

Conversely, when interest rates decrease, bond prices tend to increase as investors seek out higher yields and are willing to pay more for older bonds with higher interest rates.

978,"Rising interest rates can have a significant impact on bond investing. When interest rates increase, the value of bonds decreases, as investors can earn higher returns from new bonds with higher interest rates. This is known as interest rate risk. As a result, the prices of existing bonds with lower interest rates will fall, making them less attractive to investors. This can lead to a decrease in demand and an increase in supply, further driving down prices. However, longer-term bonds will be affected more than shorter-term bonds, as they are more sensitive to changes in interest rates. The impact of rising interest rates on bond investing also depends on the type of bond. For example, government bonds are considered safer investments, so their prices may not be as affected compared to riskier corporate bonds. It is important for investors to closely monitor interest rate changes and consider diversifying their portfolio to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates on their bond investments.","Nov 27, 2023 ¬∑ 8:03 PM UTC"

1174,"A Primer on Japan's economic woes:  In March 2022, the Fed aggressively raised interest rates from ~0% to the current 5.5%.  The higher interest rates from the Fed led to a crash in bond prices (resulting in an increase in their yields). Below is a chart comparing the 10-Year US Treasury (UST) and the 10-Year Japanese Government Bond (JGB).  The spread between the two curves has widened significantly in recent years due to the Fed's interest rate hikes in the US.  Yields on the 10-Year Japanese debt are significantly lower than in the US because the Bank of Japan (BOJ) manipulates rates through Yield Curve Control (YCC) on the 10-Year JGB.  Under YCC, the BOJ sets a target yield for the 10-Year JGB, historically aiming for a range of 0% to 0.1%. They allow JGBs to fluctuate within that range and buy/sell if it goes above/below their target range. With YCC, the BOJ can purchase virtually unlimited amounts of 10-Year JGBs to support their mandate and hold them on their balance sheet.  With JGB yields set low, investors have little incentive to hold these bonds, currently yielding only 0.5% to 1%, compared to the 4.7% yield on the 10-Year US Treasury.  In other words, investors are selling low-yielding JGBs in favor of higher-yielding debt, such as US Treasuries. The selling of Japanese debt has caused the Japanese Yen to weaken significantly compared to the US dollar.  As the Japanese Yen weakens, the USD/JPY exchange rate has reached multi-decade highs, surpassing the psychologically significant level of 150.  Japan is starting to crack Weakening Yen A weak yen poses challenges for the Japanese economy, as Japan relies on imports to meet its crucial food and energy needs. The country does not produce enough of these goods domestically, and a weak yen leads to higher prices for energy and food for Japanese individuals and businesses.  Consequently, Japanese policymakers fear that the weakening yen could result in excessively high food and energy prices, disrupting the functioning of the economy.  When energy and food prices are too high, an economy cannot function properly and may eventually come to a standstill.  Japan's massive debt When the BOJ conducts YCC, it continuously increases Japan's debt burden by essentially buying limitless amounts of Japanese debt, effectively created out of thin air.  YCC has caused Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio to inflate to a massive 267%, with the Bank of Japan alone holding 52% of that debt.  Since JGBs are just debt owed by the government, higher interest rates mean higher servicing costs for that debt that must be paid by the Japanese government.  Despite artificially keeping bond yields low through yield curve control, 23% of Japan's 2022 budget was allocated to service the national debt.  There is limited room to raise interest rates in Japan due to the massive debt load, and doing so would exacerbate the already alarming debt problem. The budget lacks space for increased spending to service the national debt.  So, spending 23% of the budget to service debt is bad, it gets even worse when Japan is forced to raise interest rate targets for its YCC, as it has in recent months.  As I mentioned earlier, the BOJ has historically targeted 0%-0.1% on the 10 year JBG for its YCC, however it has recently been forced to raise those targets in an attempt to stop the weakening of the Yen.  Japan is stuck between a rock and a hard place.  High interest rates in the US create problems for Japan.  Japan has been forced to raise yield targets for its YCC program to slow the weakening of the Yen. However, this action results in higher financing costs for the Japanese government, which cannot afford these costs without taking on additional debt, furthering the debt spiral.  Even with the increased targets for its YCC policy, the Yen continues to decline against the USD. Further adjustments to YCC will be necessary to halt the Yen's slide.  On the other hand, energy and food are primary inputs for the economy. If the BOJ takes no action to prevent the weakening of the Yen, high energy and food prices could push Japan's economy into a depression.","Nov 23, 2023 ¬∑ 12:23 AM UTC"

1281,"Gold ü™ôü™ôü™ô Algorithm since 2008 One of the best tools for market hedging.   Reason why to trade Gold or $GC  Diversification: Gold often has a low or negative correlation with other asset classes like stocks and bonds. This means when the stock market declines, gold prices might remain stable or even increase. Including gold in an investment portfolio can thus help in diversifying risks.  Inflation Hedge: Gold is widely regarded as an effective hedge against inflation. When the value of a currency decreases due to inflation, gold prices often increase. This is because gold retains its value better than many paper currencies or financial assets.  Safe Haven Asset: In times of economic uncertainty or geopolitical instability, investors often turn to gold as a safe haven asset. Its value is perceived as being more stable over the long term, compared to other assets that might be more volatile or subject to market whims.  Currency Fluctuations: Gold can also be used as a hedge against currency fluctuations, particularly in the forex market. Since gold is priced in U.S. dollars, it can be a strategic asset for investors holding currencies that might depreciate against the dollar.  ‚úçÔ∏èThe one I prefer here below! Market Uncertainty and Volatility: During periods of high market volatility or uncertainty, such as during economic recessions or crises, gold is sought after for its perceived stability.  @AnthonyCrudele","Nov 21, 2023 ¬∑ 1:46 PM UTC"

1508,"2 things stand out in this chart. First this is a chart of the 30 yr, 10 yr, 1 yr & 3 month t-bill interest rates from 12/31/1979. Second, understand that bond prices rise when rates fall.   2020 is the first/only  time in the 44 years of this chart when the rates for ALL these maturities converge on zero. In 2008, the 30 yr & 10 yr interest rates were robustly positive even as the Fed crushed short term rates. From being in that market, I remember persistent panic about hyperinflation. And you can see spikes in the 30 yr & 10 yr rate in 2010, 2011 and 2013. This occurred as the US and world economy teetered at/near deflation.  The Fed was hoovering up every bond it could find to spread liquidity as far and wide as possible.   So, the bond market making a wrong way bet on lower rates even as the Fed (and inflation, employment, consumer spending, GDP etc) points to higher for longer is not out of character.   One more thing to point out thats different now. If you look at the chart, you'll see one big difference in this rate cycle. Long rates are lagging short rates higher leaving a inverted yield curve in place for nearly 2 years now. 2 years? With no recession or crisis or crash. Hmmm. üßêü§îü§® Yeah, something is different this time around. I believe its the cumulative effect of Fed's ZIRP/QE (quantitative easing) and the astonishing spending binge of the US govt in the pandemic. There is way too much money in the system. This is why even after 2 years of rates rising, QT (quantitative tightening) there is no recession, crisis, crash. Its business as usual. Bond buyers are looking back in hope at the last 14 years and wishing for it to come back. But, all the signals point to higher for longer, no disaster, no recession, no crisis, no crash and most importantly no cuts from the Fed.  In my opinion, rates stay in and around current levels for a long time.","Nov 16, 2023 ¬∑ 11:31 PM UTC"

This could negatively impact stock prices, as investors often value companies based on their earnings.  Financial Strain: Inability to refinance debt at lower rates could strain the financial health of companies, potentially leading to credit issues or even bankruptcies. This uncertainty and financial instability can cause stock prices to decline.  Reduced Market Confidence: If the Federal Reserve is not supporting companies by buying their bonds, it might signal a lack of confidence in those companies. This lack of backing can erode market confidence, leading to investor hesitation and potential sell-offs.  Economic Slowdown: Constraints on pricing power and profitability could indicate a broader economic slowdown or contraction, which generally isn't favorable for stock markets. Slower economic growth can lead to reduced corporate earnings and dampen investor sentiment.

2098,"High interest rates in the US are causing Japan to crack  In March 2022, the Fed initiated aggressive interest rate hikes, raising interest rates from ~0% to the current 5.5%.  The higher interest rates from the Fed led to a crash in bond prices(an increase in their yields). Below is a chart comparing the 10-Year US Treasury (UST) and the 10-Year Japanese Government Bond (JGB). The spread between the two curves has widened significantly in recent years as the Fed raised interest rates in the US.  Yields on the 10-Year Japanese debt are significantly lower than in the US because the Bank of Japan (BOJ) manipulates the rates on the 10-Year JGB through Yield Curve Control (YCC).  Under YCC, the BOJ sets a target yield for the 10-Year JGB, historically aiming for a range of 0% to 0.1%. They allow the JGBs to fluctuate within that range and buy/sell if it goes above/below their target range. Under YCC, the BOJ can purchase virtually unlimited amounts of 10-Year JGBs to support their mandate and park them on their balance sheet.  With JGB yields set low, investors have little incentive to hold these bonds, which currently yield only 0.5% to 1%, compared to the 10-Year US Treasury's 4.7%.  In other words, investors are selling low-yielding JGBs in favor of higher-yielding debt, such as US Treasuries. The selling of Japanese debt has caused the Japanese Yen to weaken significantly compared to the US dollar.  With the Japanese Yen weakening, the USD/JPY exchange rate has reached multi-decade highs, surpassing the psychologically significant level of 150.  Japan is starting to crack A weak yen causes problems A weak yen hurts the Japanese economy as Japan relies on imports to meet its vital food and energy needs. Japan does not produce enough of these goods domestically, and a weak yen drives up the prices of energy and food for Japanese individuals and businesses.  For this reason, Japanese policymakers fear that the weakening Yen could lead to excessively high food and energy prices, which can disrupt the functioning of the economy.  When energy and food prices are too high, an economy cannot function properly and may eventually come to a standstill.  Japan's debt causes problems When the BOJ conducts YCC, it continuously increases Japan's debt burden because it essentially buys limitless amounts of Japanese debt, which is effectively created out of thin air.  YCC has caused Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio to inflate to a massive 267%, with the Bank of Japan alone holding 52% of that debt.  Since JGBs are just government debt, higher interest rates translate to higher servicing costs for that debt, which must be paid by the Japanese government.  Despite artificially keeping bond yields low through yield curve control, 23% of Japan's 2022 budget was allocated to service the national debt.  There is limited room to raise interest rates in Japan because of the massive debt load, and doing so would exacerbate the already alarming debt problem. There is no room in the budget for increased spending to service the national debt.  So, allocating 23% of the budget to service debt is concerning, and it becomes even more problematic when the BOJ is forced to raise interest rate targets for its YCC program, as it has done in recent months.  As mentioned earlier, the BOJ historically targeted 0% to 0.1% for the 10-Year JGB in its YCC program, but it has been forced recently to raise those targets to 0.5% to 1%, where it stands today, in an attempt to halt the Yen's weakening.  Japan is stuck between a rock and a hard place.  High interest rates in the US create a problems for Japan.  Japan has been compelled to raise yield targets for its YCC program to counteract the weakening of the Yen, but this leads to higher financing costs for the Japanese government, which cannot afford these expenses without taking on additional debt, exacerbating the debt spiral.  Even with the increased targets for its YCC policy, the Yen continues to decline against the USD. Further adjustments to YCC will be necessary in order to halt the Yen's slide.  On the other hand, energy and food are the primary inputs for the economy. If the BOJ takes no action to prevent the weakening of the Yen, high energy and food prices could push Japan into an economic depression.","Nov 7, 2023 ¬∑ 8:29 PM UTC"

2316,"WEEKEND RANDOM MACRO THOUGHTS   1. Remarkably, bond prices exhibited an upward trajectory, primarily due to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs slightly easing its monetary stance, while anxiously gauging forthcoming growth and economic indicators. Bonds ceased their downward slide, and equities saw a modest resurgence, with most hoping we‚Äôve traversed the peak of yield pressures.  2. It‚Äôs an unwritten rule not to go against the Federal Reserve or Treasury; instead, one should align with their policies. This principle was duly observed by both the stock and cryptocurrency markets. Let‚Äôs move in sync because it appears the Fed has completed its course. The only foreseeable direction for liquidity is upward from here.  3. Another positive development unfolded in the markets this week: growth figures proved to be rather lackluster. (Good when economy is bad) Both the ISM (Institute for Supply Management) and NFP (Non-Farm Payrolls) data disappointed. This implies that the Fed is unlikely to opt for further tightening.  4. Adding to the market‚Äôs favor is the seasonality factor; historically, the fourth quarter tends to be robust.  5. The sole element that might stir our concerns is inflation figures, a metric largely contingent on oil prices, which, in turn, hinge on the unfolding of geopolitical conflicts.  In sum, I foresee the next couple of months as being overwhelmingly bullish for stocks and risk assets. It‚Äôs a ride worth embarking upon.

Spot gold contracts rose by 0.4% to $1,994.28 per ounce at 3:14 PM local time after reaching a high of $2,003.69 per ounce during the session. US gold futures increased by 0.3% to $1,999.2 per ounce.  US job growth in October was slower than expected, while easing wage inflation indicated that labor market conditions were loosening. Data showed that employers added 150,000 jobs in October, lower than the 180,000 predicted by economists.  Phillip Streible, Chief Market Strategist at Blue Line Futures in Chicago, stated, ""If the labor market starts to weaken, the Fed won't be able to maintain its hawkish stance. The data reinforces the view that the Fed will stop raising interest rates, which is supporting gold.""  Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding gold.  The US Dollar Index dropped by 1%, and the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond reached its lowest level in over a month. These developments are also providing support for the rising gold prices.  According to CME's FedWatch tool, the market now discounts a 95% probability that the US central bank will keep interest rates unchanged in December, up from 80% before the data was released.  Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at OANDA, said, ""The $2,000 per ounce level is a significant psychological barrier for gold, and momentum indicators suggest that this could be a pivotal moment for gold prices.""  Investors are also monitoring the situation in the Middle East. Gold has risen more than 7% in October due to safe-haven demand.

2338,"The rise in bond yields is now slowing again and asset prices will benefit short term, but will it be enough to fuel a sustainable rally?  I thought this is a good time to remind everyone that real sustainable accumulation for long-term investing in stocks begins when bond yields fall or at least stop rising for an extended period while stocks fall or move sideways - these usually mark the moments of maximum opportunity.  It is important to always look at bond yields in the context of the ongoing trends in the stock markets - that's why I wanted to share this chart - stagnating or falling yields and nice buying opportunities are what we should be prepared for in 2024.  The chart shows the relationship between bond yields (white line / volatility-adjusted & inverted) and the US stock market (red line) over the past 10 years.  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è The momentum of the US stock market is currently fairly low (red line) - it actually hit bottom levels last week and respectively the inverted momentum average of bond yields (white line) is also relatively low (which means yields are relatively high and might start to trend sideways or down soon / I can imagine one more irresponsible push higher in Q2 2024 to create a buying opportunity, but after that the rate hike cycle should be over). That's nothing new so far, but it helps with managing expectations.  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è From 2008 to 2021 stock market momentum (red line) and inverted bond yields (white line) were negatively correlated - the trend in yields was mostly leading the stock market by about 1 year and yields were a good indicator to predict the trend in the stock markets. This dynamic changed in 2021, inverted yields (white line) went down alongside the stock market momentum and the inverted momentum for yields did not yet cross over the stock market momentum which means real yields kept rising and markets kept slowing down.  We did not yet see bond yields having any lasting ""supportive"" influence on stocks in 2022 or 2023. On the contrary - stocks got crushed by the fast rate hikes.  But the two momentum lines are getting close now and a crossover could happen soon. A period of sustainable accumulation for stocks could.

This drop in bond yields was due to the market's anticipation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may have completed its interest rate hikes, while investors awaited the US non-farm payroll data for further signals.  Spot gold contracts maintained their level at $1,981.69 per ounce, while US gold futures increased by 0.1% to $1,989.20 per ounce.  The US dollar index declined, and the 10-year US treasury bond yield approached its three-week low, making gold more attractive. Bob Haberkorn, a senior market strategist at RJO Futures, stated, ""Gold strengthens when there are cracks in the US labor market, which could signal the Fed's halt to interest rate increases.""  Data showed a modest increase in weekly jobless claims in the US, as the labor market continued to exhibit significant signs of slowing down.  The Fed decided to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday as policymakers assessed whether financial conditions were tight enough to control inflation.  According to CME Group's FedWatch tool, the market currently discounts an 85% likelihood of the Fed keeping interest rates steady in December.  The market will also closely monitor the US non-farm payroll report on Friday for further insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy direction.  Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding gold. Gold had already increased by over 7% in October and surpassed the crucial $2,000 per ounce mark the previous week due to safe-haven demand amid increased market volatility.  Spot silver contracts decreased by 1% to $22.75226 per ounce, platinum lost 0.2% at $918.71 per ounce, and palladium increased by less than 0.1% to $1,103.6418 per ounce.  Shares of precious metal producer Sibanye Stillwater, based in Johannesburg, dropped by over 3% after the company announced that they were considering further adjustments to their palladium mines in the US due to a more rapid decline in metal prices than anticipated. #Goldprices #USdollar #FederalReserve","Nov 3, 2023 ¬∑ 1:49 AM UTC"

2491,"Is the golden ""avoidance era"" opening?  However, in the stage of rapid rise in real interest rates of U.S. bonds last year and the second quarter of this year, even with the support of geopolitical conflicts and the central bank, gold prices still suffered obvious downward pressure, with a maximum decline of 20% and 10% respectively.  Therefore, if we want to use gold as part of asset allocation, we ultimately need to pay attention to the macro-cyclical factors that drive gold prices, such as real interest rates, economic growth, inflation, monetary policy and the US dollar.  As a zero-interest asset, the biggest opponent of gold is still the real interest rate of U.S. bonds. Even if the short-term correlation weakens in the short term, it is still impossible to ""spent ways"" in the long run.  At present, as the real interest rate remains high and may even continue to rise, gold, as a zero-interest asset, will continue to be under pressure. The world's largest gold financial asset is long, and the gold position of SPDR has dropped to 860 tons, a four-year low.  Of course, it may be difficult to maintain such a high real interest rate for too long. If the United States starts to cut interest rates in 2024, will this further form a trending support for gold prices?  The key is whether the premium of gold brought by the demand for risk aversion will gradually disappear.  That is to say, will we enter a more ""risk-averse era"" or a ""risk era"" in the future?  This issue is controversial even within policy institutions and financial institutions.  On the one hand, inflation is being controlled as the biggest risk to the global economy after the epidemic. On the other hand, the market is still worried about the risks that may be caused by the degree of recession and rapid austerity.  However, from the current situation, the United States has been calling for a recession since the beginning of the year, and the growth is still accelerating. The year-on-year ratio of U.S. real GDP in the third quarter was 4.9%, which rose significantly and better than expected. It is surprising that commodity consumption spending in the United States remains strong, and sales of new houses have also exceeded expectations.  This shows that the growth momentum of the U.S. economy, as a locomotive, is still very strong. Even if the market has always expected that the marginal growth rate of demand will slow down in the future, the slowdown is still much better than expected with the support of the job market and consumption.  China increased stability, Europe suspended interest rate hikes, and Japan withdrew in an orderly manner. At the same time, under the increase of the loose policy, China has gradually entered the end of de-libreasing, and the economy is likely to bottom out. The European Central Bank has pressed the pause button for raising interest rates or entered a more moderate recession, and the easing of inflation is also driving a slight rebound in economic activity. Japan's economy has achieved three quarter-on-quarter growth, and the YCC policy is also withdrawing in a further orderly manner.  Judging from the growth prospects of the top five economies, there seems to be insufficient evidence to enter a new era of more risk aversion in the future.  Of course, no one knows whether the conflict in the Middle East will escalate, whether there will be new geopolitical conflicts, or a new Silicon Valley banking incident.  Leaving aside these sudden factors, gold is no longer cheap at present. According to the calculation of brokerage research reports, its relative long-term pricing model price has been overestimated by about 33%.  Is $2,000 per ounce the high point of gold or the new starting point of gold? Is it the era of risk aversion or the era of risk?

Crude oil prices also dropped after news of the release of two American hostages by Hamas.  üéØThe 10-year US Treasury bond yield reached 5.001% in after-hours trading on Thursday, marking the first time it had crossed this threshold since July 2007. However, on Friday, bond yields reversed and closed the session at 4.9%.  üéØIn addition to the Israel-Hamas conflict, investor sentiment on Wall Street this week was negatively affected by concerns about high interest rates. The S&P 500 fell by 2.4% for the week, the Dow Jones declined by 1.6%, and the Nasdaq lost 3.2%. For the Nasdaq, this was the second consecutive week of losses.  üéØNevertheless, in his Thursday statement, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that inflation remains too high, signaling that the Fed is not planning to lower interest rates in the near future.  üéØCrude oil prices initially rose at the start of the session but closed lower. Brent crude oil, traded in the London market, fell by 0.22 USD per barrel, equivalent to a 0.2% decrease, closing at 92.16 USD per barrel. WTI crude oil for November delivery in New York dropped by 0.62 USD per barrel, or 0.7%, closing at 88.75 USD per barrel.  üéØOil prices are still supported by forecasts that the oil market will tighten in the fourth quarter of this year, as Saudi Arabia and Russia continue to cut production. Additionally, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo mentioned that global oil inventories, especially in the United States, have decreased, which is also supporting oil prices.

However, what does China gain from this, especially when the US imports a lot of goods from China, and China itself is facing the risk of a recession? Furthermore, selling now means they're at a loss.  2- China might need the money for something, possibly to use it to buy Chinese Yuan as the exchange rate with USD has not been favorable for years.  3- They may be concerned about the US defaulting, although the likelihood of default is almost non-existent when the Fed can print money.  4- It could simply be an effort to rebalance the national assets. üí∞üìâ  #China #USGovernmentBonds #InterestRates #EconomicStrategy","Oct 21, 2023 ¬∑ 5:05 AM UTC"

Furthermore, selling now would result in losses.  2- China may need the money for something, possibly for buying the Chinese $Yuan as its exchange rate against the $USD has not been favorable in recent years.  3- They might be concerned about the US defaulting, although the likelihood of this is low since the Federal Reserve can print money.  4- It could simply be a move to rebalance the national assets.

3760,"#CryptoNews #cryptocurrency  China's significant sale of U.S. government bonds, combined with the current high-interest rates, raises questions about the motivations behind this move. The relationship between interest rates and bond prices is inverse, meaning that when a large volume of bonds is sold, it tends to push bond prices down and yields (interest rates) up. Currently, the yield on the 10-year U.S. #Treasury bond is at its highest level in 16 years.  The interest rate on the 10-year #Treasury bond directly influences rates on mortgages, auto loans, and more, which can indirectly slow down economic activity.  While the exact reasons for China's bond sales may not be clear, several hypotheses have been put forward:  1. **Conspiracy Theorists**: Some may speculate that China is intentionally trying to trigger a financial downturn in the U.S. However, this raises the question of what China gains from such a scenario. China is a major exporter to the U.S., and a U.S. economic downturn could harm its own economy. Additionally, selling at a loss doesn't seem to be a beneficial strategy.  2. **Need for Funds**: China may require funds for a specific purpose, potentially related to its efforts to stabilize or strengthen its own economy. This could include bolstering the Renminbi due to unfavorable exchange rates with the U.S. dollar.  3. **Concerns About U.S. Debt**: There might be concerns in China about the level of U.S. debt, even though the risk of default is extremely low given the ability of the Federal Reserve to print money. Selling bonds could be seen as a hedge against this perceived risk.  4. **Portfolio Diversification**: It could be a simple move to rebalance China's national assets, possibly shifting from U.S. bonds to other types of assets for diversification purposes.  The exact reasons behind China's actions may remain a subject of debate and analysis among economists and financial experts.","Oct 20, 2023 ¬∑ 5:26 AM UTC"

Firstly, the relationship between interest rates and bond prices is an inverse one, so selling a lot of bonds leads to lower bond prices and higher interest rates. Today, the 10-year U.S. bond yields are at their highest in 16 years.  The 10-year bond yield directly impacts interest rates on mortgages, car loans, etc., and indirectly influences a continued economic slowdown.  As for why China is selling bonds now, only they know for sure, but there are a few hypotheses:  1. If you're inclined to conspiracy theories, you might think they are intentionally doing so to trigger a U.S. financial collapse. However, this raises questions about what China gains from this, considering the substantial imports from the U.S., and China is facing economic challenges of its own. Plus, selling now would mean taking a loss.  2. China might need the funds for something, possibly to buy its own currency, the Renminbi, since the exchange rate against the USD hasn't been favorable for years.  3. They could be concerned about U.S. default, although the likelihood of default is almost nonexistent, given the Federal Reserve's ability to print money.  4.

3785,"A relentless selloff in U.S. government bonds has brought Treasury yields to their highest level in more than a decade and a half, roiling everything from stocks to the real estate market.  The yield on the benchmark 10 year Treasury - which moves inversely to prices - hit 5% late Thursday, a level last seen in 2007. Expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates elevated and mounting U.S. fiscal concerns are among the fators driving the move.  Because the $25-trillion Treasury market is considered the bedrock of the global financial system, soaring yields on U.S. government bonds have had wide-ranging effects. The S&P 500 is down about 7% from its highs of the year, as the promise of guaranteed yields on U.S. government debt draws investors away from equities. Mortgage rates, meanwhile, stand at more than 20-year highs, weighing on real estate prices.  ""Investors have to take a very hard look at risky assets,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities in New York. ""The longer we remain at higher interest rates, the more likely something is to break.""  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday said monetary policy does not feel ""too tight,"" bolstering the case for those who believe interest rates are likely to stay elevated.  Powell also nodded to the ""term premium"" as a driver for yields. The term premium is the added compensation investors expect for owning longer term debt and is measured using financial models. Its rise was recently cited by one Fed president as a reason why the Fed may have less need to raise rates.  Here is a look at some of the ways rising yields have reverberated throughout markets.  Higher Treasury yields can curb investors' appetite for stocks and other risky assets by tightening financial conditions as they raise the cost of credit for companies and individuals.  Elon Musk warned that high interest rates could sap electric-vehicle demand, which knocked shares of the sector on Thursday. Tesla‚Äôs shares closed the day down 9.3%, as some analysts questioned whether the company can maintain the runaway growth that has for years set it apart from other automakers.  With investors gravitating to Treasuries, where some maturities currently offer far above 5% to investors holding the bonds to term, high-dividend paying stocks in sectors such as utilities and real estate have been among the worst hit.  The U.S. dollar has advanced an average of about 6.4% against its G10 peers since the rise in Treasury yields accelerated in mid-July. The dollar index, which measures the buck‚Äôs strength against six major currencies, stands near an 11-month high. A stronger dollar helps tighten financial conditions and can hurt the balance sheets of U.S. exporters and multinationals. Globally, it complicates the efforts of other central banks to tamp down inflation by pushing down their currencies. For weeks, traders have been watching for a possible intervention by Japanese officials to combat a sustained depreciation in the yen, down 12.5% against the dollar this year.  ""The correlation of the USD with rates has been positive and strong during the current policy tightening cycle,"" BofA Global Research strategist Athanasios Vamvakidis said in a note on Thursday.  The interest rate on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage - the most popular U.S. home loan - has shot to the highest since 2000, hurting homebuilder confidence and pressuring mortgage applications. In an otherwise resilient economy featuring a strong job market and robust consumer spending, the housing market has stood out as the sector most afflicted by the Fed's aggressive actions to cool demand and undercut inflation.  U.S. existing home sales dropped to a 13-year low in September.  As Treasury yields surge, credit market spreads have widened with investors demanding a higher yield on riskier assets such as corporate bonds. Credit spreads blew out after a banking crisis this year, then they narrowed in subsequent months.  The rise in yields, however, has taken the ICE BofA High Yield Index near a four-month high, adding to funding costs for prospective borrowers.  Volatility in U.S. stocks and bonds has bubbled up in recent weeks as expectations have shifted for Fed policy. Anticipation of a surge in U.S. government deficit spending and debt issuance to cover those expenditures has also unnerved investors.  The MOVE index, measuring expected volatility in U.S. Treasuries, is near its highest in more than four months. Volatility in equities has also picked up, taking the Cboe Volatility Index to a five-month peak.","Oct 20, 2023 ¬∑ 12:00 AM UTC"

4220,"A bond's ""yield"" is the interest paid on a bond.  Bond yields have an inverse relationship with bond prices.  Increased interest rates is leading to instability in the financial system.  When market interest rates increase, previously issued bonds decrease in market price because new investors prefer to buy newly issued bonds with higher interest payments.  For example, if you were in the market to buy $1,000 of bonds and you had 2 choices, which would you pick:  Bond 1: 2% yield Bond 2: 6% yield  If the prices for both were the same, any rational investor would prefer Bond 2.  This means demand for Bond 2 increases and demand for Bond 1 decreases.  Sometimes, bondholders become desperate to sell their bonds because they are in immediate need of cash.  This could mean the market becomes flooded with bonds for sale.  When demand decreases but supply remains constant or increases, price decreases.  Over the last year and a half, the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) has increased the Fed Funds Rate (the lowest interest rate to borrow US Dollars) from 0.25-0.50% to 5.25-5.50% in an attempt to fight inflation.  This has led to bond yields skyrocketing.  Before these rate increases, banks used customer deposits to buy bonds at low yields.  Those bonds have lost 40-50% of their value (due to rising rates).  Banks currently have massive unrealized losses on their balance sheets (they haven't sold their bonds yet).q  If banks receive too many withdrawal requests, they may not be able to fulfill the requests.  This could lead to trust in the financial system fading away and can lead to a complete collapse in the global financial system.  To avoid this, the Federal Reserve may eventually be forced to step in to buy those bonds at face value with newly issued money so regional banks can satisfy withdrawal requests.  This is what may happen to the US banking system in the near future.  It's only a matter of time before the Federal Reserve is forced to step in to buy bonds that have lost significant value to protect the financial system.  This is NOT how it should work.  The financial system is a house of cards, and it relies on depositors leaving their money deposited.  As more people learn about investing and want to buy assets instead of leaving their money in a bank account, the financial system will become more unstable.  Individual depositors can make or break the financial system!","Oct 15, 2023 ¬∑ 6:40 AM UTC"

Israel bonds saw falling prices and rising yields, and the stock market extended its 6.5% decline from Sunday, marking the worst shock since the Covid pandemic.   The turmoil is attributed to ongoing conflicts in Israel and Gaza affecting the bond market, resulting in higher bond yields and lower prices, signaling expectations of prolonged high-interest rates. While Fed sounds dovish for November, current rates will likely plateau for now.  This could mark the end of historically low 'emergency' rates seen after the Credit Crisis and further lowered during Covid.   Consequently, this will impact mortgage rates, potentially leading to more expensive loans and real estate market disruptions. High debt yields also mean increased mortgage costs for renewers, locking out first-time buyers and increasing inventory as sellers face reduced demand and have to lower prices to be able to sell.   Overall, normalized financing charges are now three times what they were 18 months ago, making high-paying, low-risk bonds an attractive option while posing challenges to real estate and mortgage markets.

As for prices -- I have a hard time believing that home prices would be *higher* without Fed intervention.  Why would that be?  It's very difficult to compare the period of 1963 to the mid 1980s, which had a great deal of population and productivity growth, with the financialization that came from the mid 1980s on (including the housing bubble that grew through 2006).  I think it's also hard to compare the 1960s with the 1970s, since inflation did play a role in all prices starting in the 1970s. I think the whole point is that if the Fed had not intervened, we would be looking at a very different graph starting in 2009, and the annualized gains on those houses would have been much lower.","Oct 11, 2023 ¬∑ 12:38 AM UTC"

4613,"MORE ADVANCED REAL-ESTATE STUFF:    In theory, real-estate prices should trade in a manner that is 100% correlated to bonds...and be easy to calculate!   The price should be the ""discounted value of all future potential rental cashflows""   (yes, this even applies to a principal residence because you are an equity owner who is forfeiting market rent)  Since there is no end to rental payments (cashflows).... we would call this a perpetuity. (like a pension)  Real-estate can be perpetuity because land doesn't depreciate or disappear.  Since rent increases every year, we would then call this a growing perpetuity.   Luckily, the formula for a growing perpetuity is one of the easiest in all of finance!  PV = P / (r - g)  4 numbers, thats!   PV = Present Value  P = cashflow received  r = Discount Rate / 100  g = Payment Growth Rate / 100  The discount rate (the amount of profit you demand to do the deal) in the formula could be the 10 year bond yield + risk premium AFTER COSTS. (this is called the cap rate)   So...lets try it!  Lets assume:   the rental growth rate (g) = 2.5% per year  and, you demand a 4% risk premium vs bonds for the hassle of dealing with tenants.   And lets use a home which CASHFLOWS $12,000 per year after costs, as our example.  (we ignore mortgages because this is a totally separate deal which you MAY have with a bank. Some investors dont have this cost, so its not a REAL expense)  Home price in 2021 with 0.5% 10 year bond yields:   Our demanded return is now 4.5%/yr or we would  just buy bonds.... so:   PV =  $12,000/yr / (4.5% - 2.5%)   PV = $600,000  Your home is worth 600k!   Home price in 2023 at 4.2% 10 year bond yields:  PV = $12,000/yr / (8.2% - 2.5%)  PV = $210,526.32  YOUR HOME PRICE GOT CHOPPED BY 66%   ...when bond rates rose from 0.5% to 4.2% because the asset you own STILL cashflows the SAME AMOUNT as before...  but the market can get what you're cashflowing by putting out 66% LESS money than would have been required in 2021.  In reality, real-estate is more complicated because emotion gets involved.   But in business, its just 4 numbers!  üßÇ","Oct 10, 2023 ¬∑ 11:41 PM UTC"

Commercial property prices rolled over in 2022, see pic (using L&G fund as proxy, but most have rolled over)   And bonds which rolled over in '22, have now taken a second (and unprecedented) huge step down, as shown by the (supposedly) low risk (low equity) fund from a leading provider of tracker funds.

5074,"A bit dismal but this is worth reading and understanding as it applies to our current economy:  While it's generally true that government bond prices rise (and yields fall) in a weak economy on the verge of a recession, there could be scenarios where government bond prices might fall. Here are a few potential reasons:  1. **Rising Interest Rates**: If the central bank is raising interest rates to combat inflation, this could lead to falling bond prices¬≥. Higher interest rates make newly issued bonds more attractive than existing ones, leading to a decrease in the price of existing bonds¬π.  2. **Inflation Expectations**: If investors expect inflation to rise significantly in the future, they may demand higher yields to compensate for the loss of purchasing power. This would lead to falling bond prices¬≥.  3. **Increased Supply of Bonds**: If the government is issuing a large amount of debt, the increased supply could potentially lead to lower bond prices if demand doesn't keep up¬≤.  4. **Decreased Demand for Bonds**: If investors are moving their money into other types of investments (like stocks or commodities), this could decrease demand for bonds and lead to lower bond prices¬≤.  5. **Credit Risk**: If investors perceive an increased risk that the government will default on its debt, they may demand a higher yield to compensate for this risk, leading to lower bond prices¬≤.  6. **Monetary Policy Changes**: The Federal Reserve's decisions can greatly impact bond prices. For example, if the Fed decides to taper or end its bond-buying program, this could lead to lower bond prices¬π.

5239,"üåê Impact of Decreasing Bond Prices in a Rising Interest Rate Economy: üìà  üë• For Bond Investors: Decreasing bond prices spell lower returns and higher risks. Those who bought bonds at lower rates will see their value decline with rising interest rates. They‚Äôll also face higher opportunity costs, having missed out on new bonds with higher yields, and greater inflation risk eroding their fixed income‚Äôs purchasing power. Selling bonds before maturity? Expect lower prices in the secondary market. üìâ  üíº For Bond Issuers: A scenario of decreasing bond prices means higher borrowing costs and lesser chances at refinancing. Needing to raise funds by issuing new bonds? They‚Äôll have to offer higher interest rates to attract investors, increasing their debt service burden and potentially reducing profitability. Fewer refinancing opportunities at lower interest rates will limit financial flexibility and heighten default risk. üìä  üåç For the Economy: Decreasing bond prices can be a mixed bag. On the bright side, they can signal healthy economic growth as rising interest rates reflect higher demand for money/credit, higher inflation expectations, and better returns on alternative investments - fostering consumption, investment, innovation, job creation, and income. Conversely, it might indicate a tightening monetary policy with central banks raising rates to curb inflation and prevent overheating, which could dampen economic activity by discouraging borrowing/spending and increasing capital costs for businesses and households, potentially slowing growth, reducing output/employment, and fostering financial instability. üîÑ  üîó Further Reading:  1.Bond yields & monetary policy: Investopedia 2.Economic growth & bonds: The Balance 3.Bonds, interest rates & inflation: Business Mag  üóìÔ∏è Source: Conversation with Bing, 10/5/2023  #BondMarket #InterestRates #EconomyImpact","Oct 6, 2023 ¬∑ 4:48 AM UTC"

This could be a sign of a decoupling between the two asset classes.  üîπThere are a number of possible explanations for this decoupling. One possibility is that the market is anticipating a recession, which would lead to lower demand for oil and higher bond yields.   üîπHowever, another possibility is that the market is simply pricing in the fact that oil prices have become more volatile in recent months.  üîπA decoupling between oil prices and bond yields could have a number of implications.

Below I show how this impacts future returns on investing in stocks based on 20 years of data.  The first chart demonstrates the recent ""Richening"" of Stocks in the form of the Equity Risk Premium. This is the difference between the earnings yield on the S&P 500 and the real 10 year Bond yield. When the ERP rises, either via an increase in the earnings yield (lower P/Es) or a fall in the real yield on bonds, stocks have ""cheapened"" on a relative basis - in other words they are better relative value. The opposite is true as well - when the ERP falls, stocks have richened vs Bonds. As Chart 1 shows, the increase in real yields recently, has meant the ERP has fallen, making stocks historically quite expensive vs Bonds. This is despite the index itself having fallen 8% over that period.  Buying equities when they are expensive, even on a relative basis, has a direct impact on future returns - and this is the key point of this thread. Chart 2 shows total future returns delivered by the S&P 500 index over 3mths, 6mths, 1 year and 2 years when the ERP has been in the specified bands.  The chart shows a clear correlation between higher ERP (stocks being relatively cheaper) and higher forward returns - it does pay to buy well. But more critically, with the ERP currently at 1.6%, we sit within the lowest band at the moment that has delivered negative average returns over horizons of 3, 6 and 12 months and negligible returns out to 2 years.  The 3rd exhibit tabulates the results and includes the percentage of observations in each band that are positive. It shows in the yellow highlighted band (representing the current situation) that returns are positive less than 50% of the time which is the worst expected return probability across the potential outcomes.   In other words, buying equities at the current time comes not only with a negative expected return on average across most time horizons, but with an historical probability of loss of more than 50%.  There is a lot of value in this table. For example it demonstrates how much expected returns improve as the ERP rises, allowing investors to better assess risk adjusted returns as the situation changes.  But there is one special case I have highlighted in the table thats worthy of separate discussion so investors can watch out for it should a similar opportunity arise. That is when the ERP is BELOW 1%, or even negative. This is rare - in the last 20 years it has occurred in only 6% of months. When it appears, it is usually when earnings are troughing from a deep downcycle / recession. In fact each of the instances in our sample relate to the end of the GFC market rout - from Nov-08 through Dec-09. What you can see clearly is that this actually delivered the BEST equity returns out of all the ERP bands. Stocks do not appear cheap based on the level of the ERP because trough earnings (and the earnings yield) are so far below potential earnings. However as the market and earnings rebound and the ERP itself rebounds, strong positive returns ensue.  Something to watch out for should this cycle result in a deep #recession and market rout. Every cloud has a silver lining I guess.  #macro #VIX $VIX $SPY $QQQ #SP500 #SPX","Oct 5, 2023 ¬∑ 12:04 PM UTC"

Now, there are also toy coupons (called ""swaps"") that people trade. The price of these toy coupons is also changing. One day, the price of a 10-year toy coupon matches the ""magic price"" the store manager set for the bonds.  The news is saying, ""Hey!

5661,"Gold prices are correcting & it is now at a 6-8% discount to its all time high's ! The best & easiest way to invest in #GOLD  in India is via the SGB ! Quick snapshot of everything you would like to know about ""Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme (SGB)"" :  1. What is Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB)? Who is the issuer?  SGBs are government securities denominated in grams of gold. They are substitutes for holding physical gold. Investors have to pay the issue price in cash and the bonds will be redeemed in cash on maturity. The Bond is issued by Reserve Bank on behalf of Government of India.  2. Why should I buy SGB rather than physical gold? What are the benefits?  The quantity of gold for which the investor pays is protected, since he receives the ongoing market price at the time of redemption/ premature redemption. The SGB offers a superior alternative to holding gold in physical form. The risks and costs of storage are eliminated. Investors are assured of the market value of gold at the time of maturity and periodical interest. SGB is free from issues like making charges and purity in the case of gold in jewellery form. The bonds are held in the books of the RBI or in demat form eliminating risk of loss of scrip etc.  3. Are there any risks in investing in SGBs?  There may be a risk of capital loss if the market price of gold declines. However, the investor does not lose in terms of the units of gold which he has paid for.  4.

With bond yields at elevated levels, and if interest rates/bond yields eventually come down, bond prices will price, one could see capital gains as well.  Separately, bond yields are yield to maturities (YTM) on bonds, which assumes that the all future bond coupons are reinvested at the same rate as the YTM, which is fundamentally flawed because interest rates clearly do not stay constant.   At currently more elevated interest rates, the risk is for much lower interest rates, not higher. Lower interest rates lower future reinvestment rates, and overall bond returns.   Where do I see the risks given higher interest rates? Estimated ~20% are floating / ARM, and ~80% of personal mortgage loans are on fixed rate / FRM, hence the flow through from higher interest rates is only to new property buyers and existing ARM loans, thus seemingly lower impact to the consumer this time round.  Instead I see risks largely in US commercial real estate and leveraged loans, where majority is on floating rates. A higher for longer could cause far more skeletons to come out of the closet. The debt maturity wall is in 2024-2025, where lots of refinancing is required. So that timeframe bears watching.  Small banks owning a disproportionate higher amount of US commercial real estate also bears watching, and if it extends into another financial crisis again down the road. Will this time be different?

There are also considerations in determining the sensitivity of a bond‚Äôs price to changes in rates such as the size and frequency of the coupons. This sensitivity is called ‚Äúduration‚Äù and it is a key fixed income concept.   Regardless of a bond‚Äôs duration though, higher rates cause bond prices to fall and viceversa.   To make it more complicated, market participants use ‚Äúrates‚Äù and ‚Äúyields‚Äù differently.

6145,"Chaos In The Bond Market  Bond markets are supposed to be boring. If bonds are fun, usually it means you‚Äôre doing it wrong.  Except for last year. Bonds stopped being boring in 2022 when they started going down a lot. As their prices fell, their yields rose substantially. But yields on shorter-duration bonds (ones that mature and get paid back) rose much faster than yields on longer-duration bonds, largely because they are more under the influence of the Federal Reserve and other central banks, which control the overnight rate. In 2022, the 2 year-yield rose in anticipation of central bank hiking the overnight rate (known in the U.S. as the ‚ÄúFed Funds Rate‚Äù).  Now, it‚Äôs a completely different ball game.  Many central banks have paused or stopped raising interest rates, and some central banks are even cutting them. The market now assigns a >60% chance that the Federal Reserve is done hiking rates.  This should be good for bonds. And it is. But the chaos in the bond market continues. Why?  The first reason is that short-term yields continue to rise as expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates are priced out of the market. The second reason is that the U.S. government is issuing a TON of bonds to fund its fiscal deficits. Both reasons are causing bond investors lots of worry  What‚Äôs interesting is that now, unlike in 2022, yields on long-term bonds are rising more than yields on short-term bonds:  This is known as ‚Äúbear steepening‚Äù because the yield curve is steepening (long-term yields rising faster than short-term yields) and bonds are selling off (‚Äúbear‚Äù market in bonds).  Bear steepening is not very common. Often it occurs after a recession bond bull market at the beginning of a new economic cycle, such as in 2009 and 2020.

6467,"Stock market investors beware: stagflation is coming, and you're not ready.  If the stock market is bad now, just wait until the dollar starts falling, bonds and gold start rising, and oil prices continue to soar. That's the recipe for stagflation, a toxic economic nightmare that combines high inflation with low growth.  And very few investors are actually prepared for it.  Why stagflation is so bad for stocks  Stagflation is bad for stocks because it creates a double whammy for companies. On the one hand, their costs are going up due to inflation. On the other hand, demand for their products and services is going down due to the slowing economy.  As a result, corporate profits tend to suffer in stagflationary environments. And when corporate profits suffer, stock prices tend to follow suit.  What investors can do to prepare  If you're a stock market investor, there are a few things you can do to prepare for the possibility of stagflation:  Invest in defensive stocks. Defensive stocks are stocks of companies that sell products and services that are essential to people's everyday lives, such as food, utilities, and healthcare. These companies tend to do better in stagflationary environments because people still need their products and services even when the economy is slowing down.  Invest in real assets. Real assets, such as real estate and commodities, tend to hold up relatively well in stagflationary environments. This is because they are inflation-hedged, meaning that their value tends to rise as inflation rises.  Diversify your portfolio. Diversification is always important, but it's especially important in stagflationary environments. This is because no asset class is immune to stagflation. By diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes, you can reduce your overall risk.  Stagflation is a real threat to the stock market in the current economic environment. But by taking the steps above, investors can help to protect their portfolios from the worst effects.","Sep 26, 2023 ¬∑ 5:59 PM UTC"

6621,"üßµThread on Germany's 10-Yr Bond Yield Hitting a Decade High: üëá 1/ üìà Historical Context: The yield on Germany's 10-yr bond reaching 2.782%, its highest since July 2011, is a monumental shift. It's essential to understand that bond yields move inversely to bond prices. A rising yield typically signifies falling bond prices.  2/ üí∂ Economic Implications: This rise in yields can reflect several things: potential anticipation of inflation, expectations of tighter monetary policy by the European Central Bank (ECB), or a general shift in risk sentiment among investors.  3/ üè¶ Central Bank Decisions: The ECB, in response to changing macroeconomic conditions, might view this yield movement as a need to reconsider its policy stance. Historically low rates and quantitative easing programs could be revisited.  4/ üåç European Impact: Germany's bond market is often seen as a benchmark for Europe. A shift here can impact borrowing costs for other European nations, particularly those with weaker economies.  5/ üíº Business Environment: Higher long-term rates can translate to increased borrowing costs for companies, potentially impacting investment decisions, capital expenditure, and overall growth prospects.  6/ üè† Mortgage & Real Estate: A knock-on effect can be seen on mortgage rates. As they move up, this could temper the housing market's heat, making it more costly for consumers to finance new home purchases.  7/ üåê Global Perspective: In a globally interconnected financial system, significant yield changes in powerhouse economies like Germany can influence investor sentiment and decisions worldwide.  8/ üìä Investor Strategy: With bond prices falling (as yields rise), bond investors might need to reevaluate their portfolios. Meanwhile, the equity market can also be affected. Companies sensitive to interest rates, like those in finance or real estate, might see stock price movements.  9/ üõç Consumer Impact: If the rise in bond yields translates to higher interest rates more broadly, consumers could face higher costs on variable-rate debts, affecting disposable income and spending.  10/ üîÑ Looking Ahead: It's crucial to monitor how sustained this yield trend is. Temporary blips can be driven by short-term factors, but prolonged increases could signify structural economic shifts.  In conclusion, Germany's 10-yr bond yield hitting this decade high is more than just a statistic. It's a pulse check on economic sentiments and a precursor to potential shifts in financial strategies across Europe and beyond.   #BondYieldInsight #EconomicTrends #Trading #TradingTips #Money #Trade #Bonds","Sep 25, 2023 ¬∑ 8:46 AM UTC"

6780,"Why is it bad when the yield on bonds go up?  When the yield on bonds goes up, it can have both positive and negative implications, depending on your perspective and financial goals. Here's why some may consider it ""bad"" when bond yields rise:  Lower Bond Prices: Bond prices and yields have an inverse relationship. When yields go up, the prices of existing bonds with lower yields decrease. If you own these bonds and plan to sell them before maturity, you might incur a loss on your investment. This can be undesirable for investors seeking capital preservation.  Higher Borrowing Costs: Rising bond yields can lead to higher interest rates in the broader economy. This can make it more expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow money, potentially slowing down economic growth.  Stock Market Impact: Higher bond yields can make bonds more attractive compared to stocks. As a result, investors might shift their money out of the stock market and into bonds, potentially leading to a decline in stock prices. This can be seen as a negative for those heavily invested in stocks.  Impact on Homebuyers: Rising bond yields can result in higher mortgage rates, making it more expensive for people to buy homes. This can be a disadvantage for those in the housing market.  Government Debt Costs: Governments with substantial debt loads may face higher interest payments on their bonds when yields rise, potentially leading to budgetary challenges and increased taxes or reduced public services.  However, it's important to note that higher bond yields can also have positive aspects:  Better Returns for New Investors: Rising yields mean that newly issued bonds offer higher coupon rates, providing better returns for investors looking to purchase new bonds.  Inflation Hedge: Higher yields can act as a hedge against inflation. Bonds with higher yields can help protect purchasing power in an environment where prices are rising.","Sep 22, 2023 ¬∑ 10:26 AM UTC"

Some theories that have come to light  ‚ÄòIt was a glitch‚Äô #China (or someone) was selling down their bonds Unwinding of Basis trades  We look at these theories below:  üíª It was a glitch  The glitch coincided with an expiry of bond options, so some people are saying that this may have ‚Äòcaused a glitch‚Äô in the data.¬† Just to dispel this, the ‚Äòglitch‚Äô happened over 3 hours and happened over several bond denominations ‚Äì 2Y, 5Y, and 10Y, though was most pronounced in the 2 year.¬† It also happened, though less dramatically, in other bond markets like the Australian 2 Year which rose at the same time from 3.9% to 3.95% and has not seen the subsequent correction that occurred in the US.¬† If it was a ‚Äòdata glitch‚Äô why did it occur across so many markets and jurisdictions?  üá®üá≥ China (or someone else) were selling their bonds  One of the reasons you would see a spike in bonds yields is through the liquidation of bonds, i.e. selling them at a discount which has the opposite effect on yields, driving them higher.¬† It has been fairly well documented that both Saudi Arabia have reduced their US treasury holdings from $184 billion down to $108 billion, and more dramatically China, reducing their holdings from $1.3 trillion to $800 billion.¬† The recent tweets from The Kobeissi Letter show the dramatic sell down of US treasuries by some of these #BRICS countries.  Interestingly, Yellen this morning at the Clinton Global Initiative sat with Hilary Clinton discussing, among other things, China-US relations. Yellen stated that ‚ÄòIt would be disastrous for the US to decouple from China‚Äô - could this be an indication that China is decoupling from the US through the sale of US bonds and oversized purchases of #gold?  üíµ Bond basis trade  In a foreboding warning issued from the #FederalReserve researchers 5 day ago, they discussed possible ‚Äòdisruptions in US treasuries‚Äô due to an oversized fund trading position that caused a similar bond market crash back in 2020.¬†The article published by the Fed can be found here https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/hedge-fund-treasury-exposures-repo-and-margining-20230908.html.¬†The¬†cash-futures basis trade¬†is an arbitrage trade that involves a short Treasury futures position (currently at record highs), a long Treasury cash position, and borrowing in the repo market to finance the trade and provide leverage. These are then delivered, and the position unwound, on expiry.¬† The fact that the spike hit a level consistent with at the current Federal Reserve rate is suspicious at best and may in fact support a rapid deleveraging and Federal Reserve yield curve control to manage the situation.  üìâThe Fall of Rome  For anyone who doesn‚Äôt know about the current trend that ‚ÄòReal men think about the Fall of Rome every day‚Äô, have a look here Fall of the Roman Empire: Trend on TikTok exposes what men are really thinking | news.com.au ‚Äî Australia‚Äôs leading news site.¬†   Like we‚Äôve discussed before on Insights, sometimes you need to listen to what the whole community is telling you, and with a trend like this, there is certainly a growing ‚Äòfeeling‚Äô in the broader community that something is not quite right.

7123,"If Bonds confuse you, read this (Bonds 101):  Generally, bond prices are inversely related to bond yields, however, the relationship is more complex when there is an inverted yield curve (where the yield on short-term bonds is higher than the yield on long-term bonds).  Bond prices can be higher or lower than their face value, depending on the demand for the bond:  1) When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. This is because investors can get a higher yield on new bonds, so they are willing to pay less for existing bonds.  2) When interest rates fall, bond prices rise. This is because investors can get a lower yield on new bonds, so they are willing to pay more for existing bonds.  3) HOWEVER, when there is an inverted yield curve, the relationship between bond yields and bond prices is more complex. This is because investors are not only looking at interest rates but also at the outlook for the economy. When investors are expecting a recession, they will be willing to pay more for bonds, even if interest rates are rising.  ‚Ä¢ For short-term bonds, bond yields & bond prices follow their typical inverse relationship   ‚Ä¢ For long-term bonds, the relationship is more complex because other factors like future economic expectations can influence demand, and therefore bond prices","Sep 18, 2023 ¬∑ 5:08 PM UTC"

Collateral was also requested more quickly than usual because of the rapid market movements.

Bond prices can be higher or lower than their face value, depending on the demand for the bond:  1) When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. This is because investors can get a higher yield on new bonds, so they are willing to pay less for existing bonds.  2) When interest rates fall, bond prices rise. This is because investors can get a lower yield on new bonds, so they are willing to pay more for existing bonds.  3) HOWEVER, when there is an inverted yield curve, the relationship between bond yields and bond prices is more complex. This is because investors are not only looking at interest rates but also at the outlook for the economy. When investors are expecting a recession, they will be willing to pay more for bonds, even if interest rates are rising.  ‚Ä¢ For short-term bonds, bond yields & bond prices follow their typical inverse relationship   ‚Ä¢ For long-term bonds, the relationship is more complex because other factors like future economic expectations can influence demand, and therefore bond prices","Sep 11, 2023 ¬∑ 2:07 PM UTC"

7794,"Yes, you are right. The traditional view of bonds as a ""risk-free"" asset has been upended by the recent bear market in bond prices. This has led to concerns about the impact on pensioners, who often rely on bonds for income.    There are a number of reasons why the bond market has fallen so sharply. One reason is that interest rates have been rising. As interest rates rise, the value of bonds falls, because investors demand a higher yield for holding bonds. Another reason for the decline in bond prices is that inflation has been rising. Inflation erodes the value of bonds, because the coupons paid on bonds are fixed in nominal terms.   The decline in bond prices is a major concern for pensioners, because it could lead to lower income. Pensioners often have a large portion of their assets invested in bonds, and they rely on the income from these bonds to meet their living expenses. If bond prices fall, pensioners will have to sell their bonds at a loss, which will reduce their income.    There are a number of things that pensioners can do to protect their income in a bear market.  1‚É£Diversify their portfolios, so that they are not too reliant on bonds.  2‚É£Consider investing in assets that are less sensitive to interest rates, such as stocks or real estate. 3‚É£Additionally, they can consider buying TIPS, which are Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. TIPS are indexed to inflation, so their value will increase as inflation rises.  The recent bear market in bond prices is a reminder that no asset is truly ""risk-free."" Pensioners should carefully consider their investment options and make sure that they are prepared for the possibility of further declines in bond prices.","Sep 6, 2023 ¬∑ 6:42 PM UTC"

7806,"Hello Followers, Friends, and Family.  Kareem here with another quick market report. Today, we can see the indices declining in early trading while the dollar continues to rise causing  asset prices like gold, silver, and bond prices to decline precipitously. More so, inflation concerns are providing tailwinds for interest rates to resume rising above the 7% handle.   In my estimation, interest rates will continue to rise, possibly into double digits, exerting  significant downward pressure on housing prices in the coming fiscal year. Housing prices may  worsen quicker if and when builders increase their inventories and investors unload their real  estate assets to realize profits. From a lending perspective, underwriting has tightened causing mortgage demand to fall to a level not seen since 2008-2009.   What does this mean for the average US homeowner?   As affordability declines, it creates a void to be filled between savers and spenders. The US  homeowner can take advantage of this void by being financially solvent and financially astute  mitigating downside risk by adding assets during the coming market downturn. Also, minimizing  debt while increasing income sources will also limit a homeowners financial risk.

7812,"Will be important for not only bond prices but also stock prices to see what maturities the Treasury selects to issue. The temptation will be to issue short maturities and not to pressure long dated ones with supply. Longer maturities have less liquidity and depth than Bills.  Long dated maturities impact financial asset and real estate values more than short term rates.  When recently rebuilding the TGA the Treasury overwhelmingly issued short dated paper.  Stocks were fine with the TGA rebuild issuance in part because the RRF drew down to buy that short dated paper and there was not a big liquidity drain in bonds or stocks to purchase the Treasury issued paper.  The money market funds that bought the TGA rebuild issuance and which are major RRF owners cannot buy anything but Bills and short paper.  The point?  Issuance demands are rising with both QT and expanding deficits and the Biden Treasury will do everything they can to keep rates low so not to send lower stocks and bonds and real estate going into the election.
